Created class Core.class
Here you can add components to two JPanels drawArea and controlArea.

FileTree class creates Jlist called dataList with implemented ListSelectionListener.
dataList loads images from directory "backgrounds" set in my_dir variable. 

DrawImage class displays JLabel picLabel which should display selected image, but here I have problem.
Problem is can't pass value from ListSelectionListener called "lListener" from FileTree class to DrawImage class.
